# OSF15_Project1

Run the ./ps_tester to unit test your process scheduling library
Run the ./ps_analysis to do a integrated test of your process scheduling library
Run the ./pcb_generator to create an binary file of Process Control Blocks

To run the unit test and analysis program. 

cd build
cmake ..
make

RUN THE UNIT TESTER
=======================================================================

./ps_tester <number> 

number 
1. will test all non schedule functions and First Come First Served
2. will test all non schedule functions and Shortest Job First
3. will test all non schedule functions and Shortest Remaining Time First
4. will test all non schedule functions and Round Robin


GENERATE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE BINARY FILES
=======================================================================

./pcb_generator <pcbFileName> <number of pcb> <random seed value>


ANALYSIS SECTION 
=======================================================================
./psb_generator TestPCBs.Bin 50 1337

Report Your Required AVG TURN AROUND TIME AND AVG LATENCY TIME inside the ANALYSIS RESULTS!

./ps_analysis <binaryTestFile> <number> 

number 
1. will read the binaryTestFile and run the First Come First Served over the read in data
2. will read the binaryTestFile and run the Shortest Job First over the read in data
3. will read the binaryTestFile and run the Shortest Remaining Time First over the read in data
4. will read the binaryTestFile and run the Round Robin over the read in data
